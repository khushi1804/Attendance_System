Attendance Marking System using Computer Vision

This project is an AI-powered attendance marking system that uses computer vision to recognize faces and store attendance records in an Excel sheet. The system automates the traditional attendance process, making it efficient and contactless.

Features

üì∑ Face Recognition: Uses OpenCV and deep learning to detect and recognize faces.

üìä Automated Attendance Recording: Marks attendance in real time and saves it to an Excel sheet.

‚è± Timestamp Logging: Records the exact date and time of attendance.

üñ• User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive UI for easy usage.

üöÄ Fast and Efficient: Can handle multiple users simultaneously.

Tech Stack

Computer Vision: OpenCV, dlib

Machine Learning: Face Recognition Model

Backend: Python

Data Storage: Excel (using pandas and openpyxl)

Deployment: Local system or cloud-based execution
